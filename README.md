## Workflow Overview

## Architecture & Design Decisions
- **MERN Stack:**
  - Chosen for rapid development, scalability, and a unified JavaScript codebase.
- **JWT Authentication:**
  - Stateless, secure authentication for admin users.
  - Tokens stored in localStorage; middleware protects API routes.
- **Question/Response Data Modeling:**
  - Each question and response uses stable MongoDB ObjectIDs.
  - Enables robust mapping between questions and answers, even after edits.
- **Handling Question Reordering & Data Integrity:**
  - Questions have persistent IDs; reordering or editing questions does not break response mapping.
  - When a question is deleted, related answers are purged from all responses to maintain integrity.

---

## Usage
### 1. Register as Admin & Create a Form
- Visit `/register` to create an admin account.
- Log in and access the dashboard.
- Click "New Form" to launch the form builder.
- Add questions (text or multiple choice), set required fields, and save.

### 2. Share a Form Link & Submit Responses
- Copy the public form link from the form details page.
- Share the link with users; anyone can submit responses (no login required).

### 3. View Dashboard & Export CSV
- Dashboard lists all your forms and their stats.
- Click a form to view, edit, or manage responses.
- Export all responses as CSV for analysis or reporting.
